Description: Eases the process of merging (primarily text) data used in social science research. joinery checks and cleans common identifiers like country names, years, political party names, names of institutions, etc. Once data are cleaned, joinery guides the user to aggregating or disaggregating the input datasets, executing final joins, and documenting those joins. See OPTED (opted.eu) project for principles and heuristics applied by joinery and for project updates.
